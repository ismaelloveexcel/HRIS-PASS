# Ascend Mobile (Unity URP)

Scaffold for the mobile-first 3D build of *Ascend: Serpent Trials*. The Unity project is not generated yet, but the folder structure, scripts, and data stubs are prepared so the team can open the project in Unity 2022.3 LTS (or newer) and start authoring scenes, Addressables, and assets immediately.

## Project Targets
- **Engine:** Unity 2022.3 LTS, URP Forward+ template.
- **Platforms:** iOS 15+, Android 11+ (ARM64).
- **Graphics Presets:** High / Medium / Low with automatic device detection.

## Folder Layout
```
unity/AscendMobile/
  ├── Assets/
  │   ├── Scripts/
  │   │   ├── Core/          <- gameplay state + services
  │   │   ├── Data/          <- ScriptableObject definitions
  │   │   └── Systems/       <- cinematics, FX, audio facades
  │   └── Addressables/      <- (to be generated inside Unity)
  ├── ProjectSettings/       <- generated when Unity project is created
  └── Packages/              <- generated by Unity
```

The `Assets/Scripts` subtree is pre-populated with C# files that mirror the existing React logic (dice, tiles, quizzes) and data schemas (board config, question banks). When Unity opens the folder it will import these scripts automatically.

## Getting Started
1. Open Unity Hub → **Add project from disk** → select `unity/AscendMobile`.
2. Choose **3D URP** template if prompted; Unity will create `ProjectSettings` and `Packages` folders.
3. Install recommended packages:
   - URP (included in template)
   - Cinemachine
   - Timeline
   - Input System
   - Addressables
   - Adaptive Performance (Samsung/Android)
4. Create URP pipeline asset and assign it in **Graphics Settings** (if Unity did not do this automatically).
5. Author the first scene (`AscendBoardScene`) and hook up the scripts described below.

## Script Overview
- `BoardDefinition` – ScriptableObject storing tile layout, ladders, snakes, and mystery tiles (mirrors `board.ts` data).
- `QuizQuestionBank` – ScriptableObject holding themed quiz questions that can be filtered by category/difficulty (mirrors `questions.ts`).
- `GameStateController` – Core deterministic turn logic (dice rolls, snake quizzes, ladder climbs) ready to plug into MonoBehaviours/UI.
- `CinematicDirector` – Placeholder MonoBehaviour exposing hooks for dice/ladders/snakes/shark sequences via Timeline or Cinemachine.
- `FXService` and `AudioSuite` – Stubs that centralize VFX pooling and adaptive music so mobile quality tiers can toggle complexity.

All scripts compile on Unity startup, even before scenes/assets exist. Designers can now create ScriptableObject instances (Right-click → **Create/Ascend/** …) to load the provided default data and tweak it visually.

## Next Steps
1. Generate Unity project files (open in editor).
2. Create URP renderer asset + quality tiers.
3. Author first `BoardDefinition` asset from the provided default data.
4. Wire `GameStateController` into a small bootstrap scene to validate dice/quiz flow on device.
